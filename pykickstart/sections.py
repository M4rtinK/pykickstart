This module exports the classes that define a section of a kickstart file.  A
section is a chunk of the file starting with a %tag and ending with a %end.
Examples of sections include %packages, %pre, and %post.

You may use this module to define your own custom sections which will be
treated just the same as a predefined one by the kickstart parser.  All that
is necessary is to create a new subclass of Section and call
parser.registerSection with an instance of your new class.

                            Use the %packages command to begin a kickstart file
                            section that lists the packages you would like to
                            install.

                            Packages can be specified by group or by individual
                            package name. The installation program defines
                            several groups that contain related packages. Refer
                            to the repodata/*comps.xml file on the first CD-ROM
                            for a list of groups. Each group has an id, user
                            visibility value, name, description, and package
                            list. In the package list, the packages marked as
                            mandatory are always installed if the group is
                            selected, the packages marked default are selected
                            by default if the group is selected, and the packages
                            marked optional must be specifically selected even
                            if the group is selected to be installed.

                            In most cases, it is only necessary to list the
                            desired groups and not individual packages. Note
                            that the Core group is always selected by default,
                            so it is not necessary to specify it in the
                            %packages section.

                            The %packages section is required to be closed with
                            %end. Also, multiple %packages sections may be given.
                            This may be handy if the kickstart file is used as a
                            template and pulls in various other files with the
                            %include mechanism.

                            Here is an example %packages selection::

                                %packages
                                @X Window System
                                @GNOME Desktop Environment
                                @Graphical Internet
                                @Sound and Video
                                dhcp
                                %end

                            As you can see, groups are specified, one to a line,
                            starting with an ``@`` symbol followed by the full
                            group name as given in the comps.xml file. Groups
                            can also be specified using the id for the group,
                            such as gnome-desktop. Specify individual packages
                            with no additional characters (the dhcp line in the
                            example above is an individual package).

                            You can also specify environments using the ``@^``
                            prefix followed by full environment name as given in
                            the comps.xml file.  If multiple environments are
                            specified, only the last one specified will be used.
                            Environments can be mixed with both group
                            specifications (even if the given group is not part
                            of the specified environment) and package
                            specifications.

                            Here is an example of requesting the GNOME Desktop
                            environment to be selected for installation::

                                %packages
                                @^gnome-desktop-environment
                                %end

                            Additionally, individual packages may be specified
                            using globs. For instance::

                                %packages
                                vim*
                                kde-i18n-*
                                %end

                            This would install all packages whose names start
                            with "vim" or "kde-i18n-".

                            You can also specify which packages or groups not to
                            install from the default package list::

                                %packages
                                -autofs
                                -@Sound and Video
                                %end

                            In addition, group lines in the %packages section
                            can take the following options:

                            ``--nodefaults``

                                Only install the group's mandatory packages, not
                                the default selections.

                                In addition to the mandatory and default packages,
                                also install the optional packages. This means all
                                packages in the group will be installed.
